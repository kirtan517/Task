# Observations

1. Image in Fuzzy MSER is clearly able to detect the stop text more effectively than the MSER algorithm
2. Fuzzy MSER can reduce the noise present in the image, thus giving importance to only the text, while MSER cannot.
3. Still Fuzzy MSER was not able to detect 'S' present in the text image.
